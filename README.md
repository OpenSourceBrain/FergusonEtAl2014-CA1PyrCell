### CA1 pyramidal cell - Ferguson et al. 2014

Ferguson KA, Huh CY, Amilhon B, Williams S, Skinner FK (2014) Simple, biologically-constrained CA1 pyramidal cell models using an intact, whole hippocampus context. [F1000Res 3:104](http://f1000research.com/articles/3-104/v1)

Izhikevich-based models of CA1 pyramidal cells, with parameters constrained based on a whole hippocampus preparation. Strongly and weakly adapting models based on the experimental data have been developed. Code produces example model output.
